# Input:
#     * 0: do nothing
#     * 1: fire left engine
#     * 2: fire main engine
#     * 3: fire right engine
# Observe:
#     * s[0]: is the horizontal coordinate
#     * s[1]: is the vertical coordinate
#     * s[2]: is the horizontal speed
#     * s[3]: is the vertical speed
#     * s[4]: is the angle
#     * s[5]: is the angular speed
#     * s[6]: 1 if first leg has contact, else 0
#     * s[7]: 1 if second leg has contact, else 0
# Rewards:
#     * a weighted score, the higher the better.
# Termination:
#     * landed: zero speed.
#     * landed: at other places or touched with speed.
